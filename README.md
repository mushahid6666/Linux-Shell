P2a Shell :
-The shell has two built in commands , history and exit. 
-The shell can be used in batch mode or interactive mode. 
-The shell supports redirection
-The shell checks for extra white spaces around input 
-The shell ensures that the redirection file gets created successfully prior to closing STDOUT
-The shell ensures that <space>!<space><num> type of commands run successfully
-In interactive mode , providing no input tot he shell will not cause  a crash 

Apart from the test cases provided we have thoroughly tested the code to ensure that the shell is robust and bug free.
